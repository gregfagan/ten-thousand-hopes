It was probably debris knocked out of earth orbit by the impact. It wouldn't take much delta V for even a satellite screw to end this mission before we've barely left the neighborhood.\n\nThe good news is we're still alive, and the hull wasn't compromised. It was a glancing blow.\n\nThe bad news is that we had to burn a significant amount of our reserve fuel to correct course, and it took out most of one of the solar arrays.\n\nThe solar array presents a real problem. We were on a tight power budget already; and now we don't even have enough to fully power the critical systems: life support, cyrogenics, hydroponics.\n\nI'll have to make some tough choices here.\n\nThe life support systems recycle the air and human waste. This is the most critical; nothing else will matter if carbon dioxide builds up and we suffocate.\n\nCryogenics represents the future of the species. Ten thousand human embryos... all that's left, besides us of course. Without full power, we can't run all of the freezers, and we'll start losing them. I've consulted with Dr. Miller, and she tells me that while there has been plenty of theorizing about the minimum viable human population, no one really knows. We can't afford to lose too many of our children.\n\nFinally, we have a stockpile of rations, but without fully powering the grow lights and other hydroponics systems, we won't be producing enough food to keep up with consumption. There wasn't enough cargo space for food for the whole trip, plus we'll need the crops when we get to Mars anyway. If we don't keep up with food production, in a couple of months we'll be starving.\n\nClark says that we can afford to divert some power away from life support to the other systems for a little while, but if the supply of breathable air drops too far we'll need to shift it back. It's going to be a balancing act.\n\nAnderson has been studying the imagery from the cameras and drones and thinks that if we could get out there and replace some of the couplers, the panels might still produce enough power to make a difference. Not everything we need, but we'd be better off than we are now.\n\nThe problem is that we're really still flying blind here. We didn't see whatever hit us, and even though space is huge, that meteor flung a lot of high speed debris. We occasionally hear pings from smaller bits bouncing off the hull.\n\nAnderson's plan is risky. It requires 3 crew in an approximately 4 hour EVA. If anything else hits us or there is some problem, we might not be able to get them back.\n\nI'm exhausted.
